            <p>The University Powerball will provide scholarship opportunities for students currently enrolled
              in an accredited college or University. The way to enter to win the weekly raffle is by submitting
              a payment of $1 along with school credentials and an email address to be entered the lottery.
              The earning of the week will be raffled off through a randomized system to generate a winner.
              The winners name will then appear on the site with a “Congratulations, you’re this week’s
              WINNER!!!”</p>
